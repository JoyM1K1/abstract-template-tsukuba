  abstract = {<p>This thesis describes the duality methods used in the tensor renormalization group method and their application to quantum simulation with cold atoms in optical lattices. Here we consider specifically the O(2) and O(3) nonlinear sigma models in two dimensions, as well as the Abelian Higgs model in two dimensions. We give numerical results from the tensor renormalization group and comparisons with other numerical methods for all three models. We give proposals for possible experimental methods with which these models could be simulated using cold atoms trapped in optical lattices as is done in ongoing experiments.</p>}

  abstract = {Using direct mass measurements and different MCRG methods we investigated the onset of asymptotic scaling and the universality of the mass gap. The standard nearest-neighbour action and a modified action with next-to-nearest neighbour coupling were studied up to correlation length ξ ∼ 1090 and ξ ∼ 330, respectively. The different methods give consistently that asymptotic scaling sets in only above ξ ∼ 500 for the standard action, while much earlier, at ξ ∼ 40, for the modified one. In full agreement with universality, the results m = (3.3 ± 0.1)ΛMS and m = (3.4 ± 0.1)ΛMS were obtained for these two cases, respectively.}
